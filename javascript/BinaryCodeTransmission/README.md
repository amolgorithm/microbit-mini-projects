- On the first microbit, the user can create a binary code using the two buttons representing 0 and 1.
- Then, they can transmit this binary string to the second microbit by pressing both buttons simultaneously.
- After that, the binary string is received at the second microbit and then converted to a decimal-base (int) value.
- Finally, this integer value is displayed on the second microbit's screen.
