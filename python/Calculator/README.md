# Microbit Calculator
Do simple calculations on your Microbit using this program.
<br>
Calculator supports fundamental arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents).

## How to use
- Press the left button once to increase the first num (addend, factor, dividend, etc.) by one.
- Press the right button once to increase the second num (addend, factor, divisor, etc.) by one.
- Give the microbit one gentle shake to change the operation (Default operation is addition. Shake to go to subtraction, twice to go to mult, thrice to sub, etc.)
- Press both buttons simultaneously to get the answer (product, quotient, sum, difference, etc.)

**NOTE:** Keep the microbit steady when not changing operations, or the shake might occur involuntarily and change the operation.
**NOTE:** As the shaking sensor is very sensitive to movement, DO NOT shake the microbit too much when changing operation, or else it may go to the next, next operation.
